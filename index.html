    <h1>Capture and Share the World's Moments</h1>

    <p>Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with
      friends and family.

      Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram
      &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.

      Oh yeah, did we mention it's free? </p>
